Clean Historical Homicides
---------------------------

Clean homicide files from the INEGI from 1990 to 2010. Because of the cutoff date for registering the files, homicides for the last year are undercounted by about 4%. Before 1994 homicides are recorded by age of registration since lots of homicides were registered without a date of occurence


Notes
=====

* Because of the cutoff date of December 31 2010 for registering homicides, the number of homicides in 2010 is undercounted by about 4%
* The data does not include homicides registered without a municipality of occurrence (about 10-30 each year)
* The data were adjusted to match the municipalities as they existed during 2007 (San Ignacio Cerro Gordo was merged with Arandas, and Tulum with Solidaridad)
