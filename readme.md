Clean Historical Homicides
---------------------------

Clean homicide files from the INEGI from 1990 to 2010. Files with the clean data will be created in the clean-data directory.


Notes
=====

* Because of the cutoff date of December 31 2010 for registering homicides, the number of homicides in 2010 is under-counted by about 4%
* The data does not include homicides registered without a municipality of occurrence (about 10-30 each year)
* The data were adjusted to match the municipalities as they existed during 2007 (San Ignacio Cerro Gordo was merged with Arandas, and Tulum with Solidaridad)
* Since there were a lot of homicides registered without a year of occurrence before 1994 I decided to use the date of registration as a proxy for year of occurrence from 1990 to 1993
