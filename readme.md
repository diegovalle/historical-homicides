Clean Historical Homicides
---------------------------

Clean homicide files from the INEGI from 1990 to 2010. Because of the cutoff date for registering the files, homicides for the last year are undercounted by about 4%. Before 1994 homicides are recorded by age of registration since lots of homicides were registered without a date of occurence
